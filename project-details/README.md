# ![MEN Stack CRUD App Project - Project Details](./assets/hero.png)

## Notes and guidance

### Project recommendations

Many apps you interact with daily can provide inspiration for this project as they are full-stack CRUD apps!

Lean towards building an app that manages or tracks things of personal interest to you.

Avoid things like games, portfolio sites, marketing, or e-commerce sites.

### Getting started

Here are some quick tips to get your project started:

- Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get feedback before you dive too deep into planning.
- ***Keep it simple.*** Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great and works well is better than extra functionality added to an app without polish.
- Theme your app to give it a personal touch.
- Prioritize and implement user stories step-by-step, one at a time. Develop features in a way that allows you to test as you go - try your best to follow the flow of data through your app.
- Regularly review the project requirements to ensure you're on track to pass the project. A printable version of the project requirements can be found [here](../project-requirements/assets/project-requirements.pdf).
- Add comments to your code where it makes sense to do so. Most code is self-documenting, and you shouldn't add comments explaining the obvious. Ideally, comments should explain the ***why*** of code where it's necessary.

### Project assistance

Your instructor team will provide guidelines for reaching out for help during project week.

## Presentation ideas

You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present your project. While the structure and content of your presentation are ultimately up to you, here are some potential ideas and topics to cover:

- Discuss the app. Including details about why you chose the app is a nice touch.
- Use the app! Demo full-CRUD data operations.
- Briefly show off something unique in your code or a piece of code you're particularly proud of.
- Share your experience with the project - what was challenging, what did you gain from building this project?
